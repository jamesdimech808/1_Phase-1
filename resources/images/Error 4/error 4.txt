This 4th error was the score going up 9 points
whenever the ball passed the player paddle or ai 
paddle. The reason was this was because the collision
detection calculates from the centre of the paddle to
edge(right for player paddle and left for ai paddle)
and the ball takes 9 frames to go from the edge of
the paddle to the centre. This in turn fools the computer
into thinking the ball passed 9 times. 

The reason this was occuring was because we need to call
this function once and stop.
