One of the first errors I experienced was when i was attempting to 
set up the paddles so that i could move both simultaneously to code
and test the colission detection. 

Since Both the Player Paddle and the AI Paddle where going to move 
with the same controls, I simply copied and pasted the player paddle
code into the ai paddle script. When i saved and tried running the game
I kept getting an error. 

Turns out, i forgot to change the class from Player to AI.
