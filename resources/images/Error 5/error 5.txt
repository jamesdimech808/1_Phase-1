Close to the end of the development, i tried to test game 
state functionality, such as starting and restarting the 
game using the spacebar. The trouble was the ball was not
respawning when it reached the goal. I kept getting a nullreference exception error.

The reason was because i used this specific if statement for the
different types of gamestates, but forgot to remove "game." because
it wasn't required. Simply removing this solved the issue. 

This was the solution to my final major error.
