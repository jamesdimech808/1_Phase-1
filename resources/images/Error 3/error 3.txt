While setting up the scores, when i was attempting to test the game out
my paddles kept dissapearing everytime i initialized the game. They were
vanishing visually, not physicially. Which meant that the ball still bounced 
off of them. 

The reason this was happening was because in the Sprite Renderer in the inspecter,
the order in layer was set to 0. 

Changing the value to 2 solved my issue and the paddles started appreading like intended.
