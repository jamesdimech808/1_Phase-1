In my second major error my issue was that the collision detection
was initiating a little too soon and it made it seem as though there 
is an invisible wall in the field. 

The reason this was happening was because the topBounds and bottomBounds
values where set 4 points to soon, and had too change the values. 

To figure out exactly what the value is, i quickly dropped the ball prefab
into the game and slowly moved it towards the desired boundary points while 
checking the Y axis in the inspector. 

Changing the values solved this issue.
